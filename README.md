This is a little app that's serves no real purpose but, I want to test some functions on JavaEE, and some frameworks like hibernate (to be implemented), and Spring.

## Dependencies
* Java Compiler: Tested on Eclipse IDE 2019-03 (4.11.0)
* Download .zip and export as .WAR
* Download Apache TomCat 8.5
* Add the servlets

## Get Started
* Just execute the application on the project level, using the JavaEE compiler AND the TomCat Server, as the servlets, that you installed
* Proceed entering the data on form, and open a view for console to see the information.
